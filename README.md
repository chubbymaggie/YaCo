# YaCo [v1.8.1](https://github.com/DGA-MI-SSI/YaCo/releases/tag/v1.8.1)

**YaCo** is an [**Hex-Rays IDA**](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) plugin.
When enabled, multiple users can work simultaneously on the same binary.
Any modification done by any user is synchronized through **git** version control.

## Motivation
**IDA** does not allow multiple users to work on the same binary.
During large malware analysis, we had to use a team of reversers and manual synchronization is a tedious and error-prone process. 

**YaCo** goals are:

  * to support all **IDA** events (renaming, structure mapping, ...)
  * to be fast (users do not want to wait when working)
  * to prevent conflicts between user modifications
  * to be easy to setup and easy to use

## Installation

### Debian stretch/x64

**YaCo** like **IDA** 7.0 is 64-bit only.

Install dependencies
```
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake libpython-2.7
```

Set IDA_DIR & IDASDK_DIR environment variables
```
export IDA_DIR=/opt/ida7.0/
export IDASDK_DIR=/opt/idasdk70/
```

Clone, configure & build **YaCo**
```
~/YaCo (master) $ cd build
~/YaCo/build (master) $ ./configure.sh
~/YaCo/build (master) $ pushd ../out/x64_Release
~/YaCo/out/x64_Release (master) $ make -j4
~/YaCo/out/x64_Release (master) $ pushd $IDA_DIR/plugin
$IDA_DIR/plugin $ ~/YaCo/build/deploy.sh
```

### Windows

CMake must be installed and in the PATH
Only visual studio 2015 & 2017 are currently supported

Configure and build **YaCo**
```
set IDA_DIR=C:\Program Files\IDA Pro 7.0
set IDASDK_DIR=C:\idasdk70
build> configure_2017.cmd
out/x64> cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
out/x64> ctest . --output-on-failure -C RelWithDebInfo -j4
```

## Usage

### First user
To create the **YaCo** environment:

  1. open binary or idb file as usual
  2. click on Edit menu, Plugins, YaCo
  3. enter path to git remote (could be a file system path, or empty to use current dir)
  4. a warning will inform you that **IDA** have to be re-launch with correct idb
  5. **IDA** auto close
  6. launch **IDA** for your FILE_local.idb file
  7. save database
  8. start working as usual

Warning, to use with multiple user, **YaCo** project must be in a bare git project.

### Other users
Setup **YaCo** environment:

  1. clone a **YaCo** project
  2. open idb/i64 file with ida
  3. click on Edit menu, Plugins, YaCo
  4. a warning will inform you that **IDA** have to be re-launch with correct idb
  5. **IDA** auto close
  6. launch **IDA** for your FILE_local.idb file
  7. save database
  8. start working as usual
  
### How it works
**YaCo** use a git server to synchronize changes between users.

In the local repository, **YaCo** stores the original IDB and incremental changes as xml files & commits.

Note that the database is not modified anymore unless you force a synchronisation.
When saving the database, we fetch remote changes, rebase local changes on top of those, import this new state into IDA and push this state to the remote git server.

Any git server should work, like github, gitlab or gitea instances.

Currently, **YaCo** only support SSH authentication. To keep the plugin user-friendly, there is no mechanism which ask for passwords & passphrases on every git operation. Instead, it is recommended to use an ssh agent, like pageant under windows or ssh-agent under linux.
